# App Code Description ‚Äî Panopticon + Compatibility Stack

CheckInInterface.html and Checkincode should not be messed with as is working fine. 
Scope of analytics: Only run on guests with Checked-In = "Y" in Form Responses (Clean) column AB.
Function changes: add new behavior via new functions (e.g., foo_v2()), don‚Äôt silently refactor. Comment why.

üß† Project README ‚Äî The Panopticon / Compatibility Analytics System
Overview

This project is an AI-structured analytics environment built around a live guest dataset collected through Google Forms. It transforms raw event responses into interactive visualizations ‚Äî including the Panopticon Wall and Compatibility Matrix ‚Äî while keeping the original check-in workflow completely intact.

All analytics run on read-only copies of cleaned data and automatically document themselves for traceability, reversibility, and machine understanding.

Core Philosophy

This system is designed to:

Observe without interference ‚Äî analytics never alter the check-in interface or raw data.

Track data evolution ‚Äî every transformation from one sheet to another is logged in a Data Dictionary.

Allow modular expansion ‚Äî new functions can bloom (expand) or collapse (contract) without breaking lineage.

Stay explainable to AI models ‚Äî every function is documented, reversible, and discoverable.

Protected Sheets
Sheet	Description	Editable By
Form Responses 1	Raw Google Form feed.	System (check-in only)
Form Responses (Clean) (FRC)	Normalized guest data. Used for all analytics.	checkInGuest, updateGuestScreenName, uploadGuestPhoto only

‚ö†Ô∏è No analytics function may write to these sheets.
All reads must filter to guests where Checked-In = "Y" (Column AB).

Analytics Layers
1. Pan_Master

Encodes validated guest data numerically for statistical analysis.

Input: Form Responses (Clean)

Output: Pan_Master

Purpose: prepare data for association strength calculations (Cram√©r‚Äôs V).

2. Pan_Dict

Validation and translation reference for categorical mappings.

Defines all valid options and numeric codes.

Used by all encoding and similarity functions.

3. V_Cramer_Cat

Computes Cram√©r‚Äôs V matrix between categorical variables.

Purpose: measure association strength between demographics, traits, and interests.

4. Guest_Similarity

Generates pairwise guest similarity scores (for compatibility visuals).

Uses: Interests, Music Preference, ‚ÄúAt Worst,‚Äù and Recent Purchase.

Excludes demographics for diversity.

Output: ranked similarity matrix for one-to-one match mapping.

5. Panopticon Wall Export

Transforms analytic sheets into real-time JSON or HTML assets for front-end visualization.

Displays dynamic guest clustering, crowd polarity, and collective metrics.

Documentation & Registry Sheets
Sheet	Purpose
Master_Desc	Auto-generated overview of all sheets, columns, data types, and samples.
Tool_Registry	Logs every function run (with version, inputs, and outputs).
Data_Dictionary	Documents from ‚Üí to mappings at column-level granularity with notes on transformations.
Function Development Rules

Every new Apps Script or AI-generated function must:

Never modify Form Responses 1 or FRC.

Document itself in:

Tool_Registry: execution, input/output lineage.

Data_Dictionary: field-by-field mapping with notes.

Call Master_Desc after creation to refresh documentation.

Include inline descriptive comments explaining its intent and data flow.

Support parameters: {expand: true|false, contract: true|false} for adaptive detail.

Use archive/rollback utilities for safe reversion (archiveSheet_(), revertLast_()).

AI Integration Rules

For LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT, Gemini) working on this repository:

Context Access

Models may read from all generated sheets except Form Responses 1 and Form Responses (Clean).

Must reference the latest Master_Desc or Data_Dictionary for structural awareness.

Code Modification Policy

AI assistants may only make function-by-function updates (no full rewrites).

Must preserve naming conventions, comments, and aesthetic layout.

Each new function must automatically append its metadata to Data_Dictionary.

Purpose of AI Collaboration

Automate analytics expansion (new similarity metrics, visual mappings).

Maintain human-readable documentation and system coherence.

Allow iterative ‚Äúexpansion/contraction‚Äù of analytics without losing traceability.
